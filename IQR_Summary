Calculate the Interquartile Range of a dataset by using the SciPy library. The main takeaway of the IQR is that it is a statistic, like the range, that helps describe the spread of the center of the data.

However, unlike the range, the IQR is robust. A statistic is robust when outliers have little impact on it. For example, the IQRs of the two datasets below are identical, even though one has a massive outlier.

dataset_one = [6, 9, 10, 45, 190, 200] #IQR is 144.5
dataset_two = [6, 9, 10, 45, 190, 20000000] #IQR is 144.5
By looking at the IQR instead of the range, you can get a better sense of the spread of the middle of the data.

The interquartile range is displayed in a commonly-used graph â€” the box plot.

In a box plot, the ends of the box are Q1 and Q3. So the length of the box is the IQR.
